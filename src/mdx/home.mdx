We are so excited to have you join us on this special day when we will commemorate our relationship
 and deep love for each other. Below are the details about the wedding ceremony and reception date, time, and location.

## Sunday, 1 September 2019
**4:00 pm** Guest arrival  
**4:30 pm** Ceremony begins  
**5:00 pm** Reception begins  

### Happy hour
After the ceremony, we will move to the foyer outside of the ballroom for hors d'oeuvres and beverages (including both
alcoholic and non-alcoholic cocktails). 

### Dinner and dessert
A buffet-style dinner will begin in the ballroom around 6:30 pm, followed by wedding cake and other desserts. 

### Museum gallery tours and musical performance 
After dessert, the modern art wing of the museum will open up for a 
two-hour private viewing and tours for our guests. The musician will continue to play in the ballroom during this time,
so you can choose to split your time between the museum galleries and the ballroom, or spend all of your time in one
or the other. 

## Location
The ceremony and the reception will both take place in the Kridel Grand Ballroom in the Portland Art Museum's 
Mark Building in downtown Portland, Oregon.

### The Mark Building of the Portland Art Museum
The art museum consists of two adjacent buildings. We will be in the Mark Building, which is **NOT** the building
with the main entrance to the museum. 

**If you search for the Portland Art Museum on Google maps, Google will give you the address to the OTHER building.**

The Mark Building is located at:
