## The Trevor Project
Founded in 1998 by the creators of the Academy Award®-winning short film TREVOR, The Trevor Project is the leading
national organization providing crisis intervention and suicide prevention services to lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, queer & questioning (LGBTQ) young people under 25.

The Trevor Project offers accredited life-saving, life-affirming programs and services to LGBTQ youth that create
safe, accepting and inclusive environments over the phone, online and through text.

The mission of The Trevor Project is to end suicide among gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, queer & questioning
young people. The organization works to fulfill this mission through four strategies:  
<ol>
<li>Provide crisis counseling to LGBTQ young people thinking of suicide.</li>  
<li>Offer resources, supportive counseling and a sense of community to LGBTQ young people to reduce the risk that they become suicidal.</li>
<li>Educate young people and adults who interact with young people on LGBTQ-competent suicide prevention, risk detection and response.</li>
<li>Advocate for laws and policies that will reduce suicide among LGBTQ young people.</li>
</ol>

## Oregon Food Bank
Oregon Food Bank's mission is to eliminate hunger and its root causes…because no one should be hungry.

Oregon Food Bank collects food from farmers, manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, individuals and government sources.
They distribute that food through a Statewide Network of 21 Regional Food Banks and approximately 1,200 food assistance
sites serving all of Oregon and Clark County, Washington.

They also address the root causes of hunger through public policy, nutrition and garden education, and public
awareness. Their nutrition and garden education programs, as well as community food organizing activities, increase
self-reliance and improve the health of communities.
