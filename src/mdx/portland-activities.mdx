For those of you visiting from outside of Portland, we think you will find a wealth of amazing experiences awaiting
you here.

Whether you enjoy sampling unique, locally-produced foods and beverages, exploring the beauty of the natural
world, or immersing yourself in memorable cultural experiences, we believe you will find more than one way
to make your visit to Oregon truly special.

Many of our guests have already told us that they plan to arrive a few days before the wedding or stay a few days
after it, so that they have time to fully enjoy their visit. If you have the time and inclination to do so, we
encourage you to do so, too!

## Experiences within Portland
In addition to the highlights for visitors, listed below, Portland is brimming with enticing restaurants catering to
every culinary preference and dietary restriction, as well as wine tasting opportunities and local breweries.

**If there is something particular you want to try in terms of food or drink, please ask us for recommendations and
we will do our best to give you suggestions!**

### Portland Walking Tours
Prajwal and Dan have taken almost every tour offered by this company (some of them several times), and it has
always been a great experience. The tour guides provide great insights into some of the unique aspects of Portland
as the tour group walks around downtown and the surrounding neighborhoods.

**We were thinking about organizing a private group tour for wedding guests. If you are interested in participating,
please let us know which tours interest you and which dates you are available, and we will look into the feasibility
of setting something up.**

### Portland Hop-on, Hop-off Trolley
This open-air trolley tour of inner Portland gives you a convenient way to get an overview of the city. Dan has taken
it with out of town visitors before and recommends it.

### Powell's City of Books
Occupying an entire city block, and rising 3 stories high, Powell's City of Books is the largest English-language,
independently-owned and operated bookstore in the world. If you visit, be sure to check out the
<a href="https://www.powells.com/findastore/powellscityofbooks/therarebookroom/">rare book room</a> on the top floor.

### Lan Su Chinese Garden
Dan and Prajwal enjoy the Lan Su Chinese Garden so much, they have had a membership there for years. If you are in the
garden during one of their <a href="https://lansugarden.org/things-to-do/events/public-tour/">frequent guided tours</a>,
we highly recommend joining the tour. Also, be sure to stop in the tea house to have some Chinese tea and a delicious
tea snack.

### Portland Japanese Garden
Nestled in Portland's Washington Park near the Rose Test Garden and the Oregon Zoo, the Portland Japanese Garden
offers different spaces, each of which has its own character, but all of which offer beauty and contemplative serenity.
It is considered by some experts to be the best Japanese garden outside of Japan itself.

### Pittock Mansion
Built in 1914, Pittock Mansion tells the story of Portlandâ€™s transformation from pioneer town to modern,
industrialized city through the history and legacy of one its most influential families, the Pittocks. Saved from
demolition by dedicated citizens in 1964, the Mansion and surrounding estate was purchased by the City of Portland
and opened to the public as a historic house museum.

### Portland Art Museum
Although we will be having the wedding here, and we will be renting out the modern art wing during the reception,
if you want to make a separate visit to see the other wing of the museum, it is worth a visit!

### The Eastbank Esplanade
This floating walkway along the eastern edge of the downtown portion of the Willamette River is a special place for
Dan and Prajwal. It is where, while sitting on a bench, watching the sun set, they had their first kiss.

### Forest Park
Forest Park is one of the largest urban parks in the world. Fully within city limits, the park nonetheless gives
visitors the feeling that they are deep in a woods well outside of an urban area.
