For those of you visiting from outside of Portland, we think you will find a wealth of amazing experiences awaiting
you here.

Whether you enjoy sampling unique, locally-produced foods and beverages, exploring the beauty of the natural
world, or immersing yourself in memorable cultural experiences, we believe you will find more than one way
to make your visit to Oregon truly special.

Many of our guests have already told us that they plan to arrive a few days before the wedding or stay a few days
after it, so that they have time to fully enjoy their visit. If you have the time and inclination to do so, we
encourage you to do so, too!
